Here is the [video walk through](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MYAHhRFvFOGCZ7dqOTOuN1JUbb1R6lSu/view) for this project.

This exercise had us create tables in MySQL to store data and then write javascript to send queries and receive data back from those tables. I also used the Inquirer NPM package to write the menu questions and plug the provided answers into the MySQL queries, along with the Tablefy NPM package to style the data returned to me.
